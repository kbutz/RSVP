== README

My first attempt using Ruby on Rails, a simple Wedding RSVP app. The goal is to allow a guest to create an account or sign-in, and provide RSVP info. I still have a lot to do! My app is based off the Treehouse "Treebook" tutorials, which I am using to gain an understanding of Rails.

Rails 4, Devise 3 for authentication, sqlite3 for db.
